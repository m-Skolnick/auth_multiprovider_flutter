# Auth, Routing, and Multiprovider in Flutter

This project is a starting point for using multi-provider and routing to control access to authenticated pages.

Overall structure: 

* Auth is a singleton that can be accessed anywhere in the app
* State for the Login and Home pages are controlled by Providers
* The Login page listens to state changes from the auth_service
